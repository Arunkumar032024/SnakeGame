# Snake Game

"Snake Game" is a classic brought to life with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. HTML sets the structure, CSS brings style, and JavaScript provides functionality. The game board, snake, and food are HTML elements styled with CSS for visual appeal. JavaScript controls game mechanics: snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking. jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, enhancing interactivity. Users navigate the snake using arrow keys, aiming to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. It's a nostalgic journey into the past, reimagined for the modern web with intuitive controls and addictive gameplay.
